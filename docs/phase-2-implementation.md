# Phase 2 Implementation Summary: Interview-Level Assessment Aggregation

**Status:** ✅ Complete and Type-Safe
**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Branch:** `feature/video-assessment-ai`

## Overview

Phase 2 implements the aggregation layer that synthesizes all per-question video assessments into a comprehensive final interview assessment. The system collects all question-level feedback and skill scores, adjusts timestamps to cumulative interview time, and uses Gemini AI to create a cohesive overall assessment.

## Architecture

### Data Flow

```
1. User completes all question assessments (Phase 1)
2. Frontend calls aggregateInterviewAssessment() → tRPC endpoint
3. Service validates all questions are assessed
4. Service fetches interview case, questions, and skills from database
5. Service builds cumulative timing map for timestamp adjustment
6. Service calls Gemini 2.5 Pro with aggregation prompt
7. Gemini returns FinalAssessment (overall score, summaries, top feedback)
8. Service stores result in InterviewAssessment table with relations
9. Frontend displays complete assessment on feedback page
```

### Key Components

**New Service:** [assessment-aggregation.service.ts](../src/server/ai/services/assessment-aggregation.service.ts)

**Modified Router:** [assessment.ts](../src/server/api/routers/assessment.ts)

**Existing Prompt:** [assessment-aggregation.ts](../src/server/ai/prompts/assessment/assessment-aggregation.ts)

**Database Tables Used:**
- `interview_question_recordings` (read assessmentData)
- `interviews` (read timing data)
- `interview_cases` (read case context)
- `skills` + `skill_domains` (read skill definitions)
- `InterviewAssessment` (write final assessment)
- `AssessmentFeedback` (write aggregated feedback items)
- `AssessmentSkillScore` (write averaged skill scores)

## Implementation Details

### 1. Main Orchestrator: `aggregateInterviewAssessment()`

**Purpose:** Coordinate the complete aggregation workflow from fetching data to storing results

**Parameters:**
```typescript
interface AggregateAssessmentParams {
  interviewId: string;
  userId: string;
}
```

**Workflow:**

1. **Validate Completion:** Verify all question recordings have `assessmentStatus = COMPLETED`
2. **Check for Existing Assessment:** Return existing assessment ID if already created (idempotent)
3. **Fetch Interview Context:** Load interview, practice session, and interview case data
4. **Collect Unique Skills:** Extract all skill IDs from question assessments
5. **Build Timing Map:** Calculate cumulative start/end times for each question
6. **Create Aggregation Context:** Assemble all data needed for AI synthesis
7. **Call Gemini AI:** Generate final assessment using aggregation prompt
8. **Store in Database:** Create InterviewAssessment with nested feedback and skill scores

**Error Handling:**
- Returns `AggregationResult` with success/error status
- Logs detailed error messages for debugging
- Throws `TRPCError` with appropriate codes for API layer

### 2. AI Synthesis: `synthesizeAssessment()`

**Purpose:** Call Gemini 2.5 Pro to synthesize all question assessments into final comprehensive assessment

**Model Configuration:**
```typescript
{
  model: GEMINI_MODELS.PRO, // "gemini-2.5-pro"
  responseMimeType: "application/json",
  temperature: 0.3,
  maxOutputTokens: 6000,
}
```

**Input:** `AssessmentAggregationContext` containing:
- All question assessments (feedback + skill scores)
- Interview metadata (duration, start/end times)
- Case context (title, description)
- All skills with domain information
- Question durations for timestamp adjustment

**Output:** `FinalAssessment` containing:
- `overallScore` (1-5): Interview-level performance rating
- `performanceLabel`: Human-readable label (e.g., "Impressive Performance")
- `whatYouDidBest` (200-500 chars): Summary of key strengths
- `topOpportunitiesForGrowth` (200-500 chars): Summary of improvement areas
- `feedbackItems`: 3-5 STRENGTH + 3-5 GROWTH_AREA items (with adjusted timestamps)
- `skillScores`: Averaged scores for each skill (1-3 scale)

**Validation:**
- Checks for required fields in AI response
- Logs processing time for monitoring
- Re-throws errors for upstream handling

### 3. Database Storage: `storeAssessment()`

**Purpose:** Persist final assessment with all relations in database

**Creates:**

**InterviewAssessment (1 record):**
```typescript
{
  userId,
  interviewId,
  caseId,
  overallScore,
  performanceLabel,
  whatYouDidBest,
  topOpportunitiesForGrowth,
  startedAt,
  completedAt,
  interviewDurationSeconds,
}
```

**AssessmentFeedback (3-10 records):**
```typescript
{
  assessmentId,
  feedbackType: "STRENGTH" | "GROWTH_AREA",
  timestampDisplay: "12:45", // Adjusted to cumulative time
  timestampSeconds: 765, // Parsed from timestampDisplay
  behaviorTitle: "Structured Problem Approach",
  whatYouDid: "You broke down the problem...",
  whyItWorked: "This demonstrates...", // STRENGTH only
  whatWasMissing: "You didn't consider...", // GROWTH_AREA only
  actionableNextStep: "Next time, try...", // GROWTH_AREA only
  impactStatement: "Derived from context",
  displayOrder: 1,
}
```

**AssessmentSkillScore (N records, one per unique skill):**
```typescript
{
  assessmentId,
  skillId,
  skillScore: 2, // Averaged from question assessments (1-3 scale)
  categoryOrder: 1, // From domain.order
  skillOrder: 1, // Alphabetical within domain
}
```

**Data Processing:**
- Parses MM:SS timestamps to seconds with `parseTimestamp()`
- Validates all skill IDs exist in database before creating scores
- Derives `impactStatement` from `whyItWorked` or `whatWasMissing`
- Filters out any invalid skill references with warning logs

### 4. Timestamp Adjustment Logic

**Problem:** Question assessments have timestamps relative to each question video (e.g., "2:15" in Question 2)

**Solution:** Convert to cumulative interview time using question durations

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Build cumulative timing map
let cumulativeSeconds = 0;
const questionDurations = recordings.map((r) => {
  const startSeconds = cumulativeSeconds;
  const durationSeconds = r.duration || 0;
  const endSeconds = cumulativeSeconds + durationSeconds;
  cumulativeSeconds = endSeconds;

  return {
    questionId: r.questionId,
    startSeconds, // When this question started in interview
    endSeconds,   // When this question ended in interview
  };
});

// Example output:
// Question 1: 0s - 300s (5 minutes)
// Question 2: 300s - 600s (next 5 minutes)
// Question 3: 600s - 900s (last 5 minutes)
```

**AI Prompt Includes:**
```
## Question Timing (for timestamp adjustment)

Question 1: 0s - 300s (cumulative)
Question 2: 300s - 600s (cumulative)
Question 3: 600s - 900s (cumulative)
```

**AI Performs Adjustment:**
- Takes Question 2 timestamp "2:15" (135 seconds into Q2)
- Adds Question 1's end time: 300s + 135s = 435s
- Converts back to MM:SS: "7:15"

### 5. tRPC API Endpoint: `aggregateInterviewAssessment`

**Location:** [src/server/api/routers/assessment.ts:546-607](../src/server/api/routers/assessment.ts#L546-L607)

**Type:** Protected mutation (requires authentication)

**Input:**
```typescript
{
  interviewId: string; // Required, min length 1
}
```

**Output:**
```typescript
{
  success: true,
  assessmentId: string,
  message: "Assessment aggregation completed successfully"
}
```

**Authorization:**
- Verifies interview exists and belongs to authenticated user
- Returns `NOT_FOUND` if interview doesn't exist or user lacks access

**Precondition Checks:**
- Counts total questions vs. completed assessments
- Returns `PRECONDITION_FAILED` if not all questions are assessed
- Error message includes progress: "Cannot aggregate: 2/3 questions completed"

**Error Handling:**
- Returns `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` if aggregation service fails
- Passes through service error message for debugging

**Usage Example:**
```typescript
// Frontend code
const { mutate: aggregate } = api.assessment.aggregateInterviewAssessment.useMutation();

aggregate(
  { interviewId: "int_xyz123" },
  {
    onSuccess: (data) => {
      console.log("Assessment created:", data.assessmentId);
      router.push(`/practice/feedback?assessmentId=${data.assessmentId}`);
    },
    onError: (error) => {
      console.error("Aggregation failed:", error.message);
    },
  }
);
```

## Data Structures

### AssessmentAggregationContext (input to AI)

```typescript
interface AssessmentAggregationContext {
  questionAssessments: QuestionAssessment[]; // From assessmentData JSONB

  interview: {
    interviewId: string;
    startedAt: Date;
    completedAt: Date;
    durationSeconds: number;
  };

  case: {
    caseId: string;
    caseTitle: string;
    caseContext: string;
  };

  allSkills: Array<{
    skillId: string;
    skillName: string;
    domainName: string;
    domainOrder: number;
  }>;

  questionDurations: Array<{
    questionId: string;
    startSeconds: number; // Cumulative start
    endSeconds: number;   // Cumulative end
  }>;
}
```

### FinalAssessment (output from AI)

```typescript
interface FinalAssessment {
  overallScore: number; // 1-5 interview-level score
  performanceLabel: string; // "Impressive Performance", etc.
  whatYouDidBest: string; // 200-500 chars
  topOpportunitiesForGrowth: string; // 200-500 chars
  feedbackItems: AggregatedFeedbackItem[]; // 3-5 STRENGTH + 3-5 GROWTH_AREA
  skillScores: AggregatedSkillScore[]; // Averaged from questions
}

interface AggregatedFeedbackItem {
  feedbackType: "STRENGTH" | "GROWTH_AREA";
  timestampDisplay: string; // Adjusted to cumulative time
  behaviorTitle: string; // 20-50 chars
  whatYouDid: string; // 100-300 chars
  whyItWorked?: string; // 100-300 chars (STRENGTH only)
  whatWasMissing?: string; // 100-300 chars (GROWTH_AREA only)
  actionableNextStep?: string; // 100-300 chars (GROWTH_AREA only)
  displayOrder: number;
}

interface AggregatedSkillScore {
  skillId: string;
  skillScore: number; // 1-3 (averaged from question scores)
  categoryOrder: number; // From domain.order
  skillOrder: number; // Alphabetical within domain
}
```

## AI Prompt Strategy

**Prompt Template:** [src/server/ai/prompts/assessment/assessment-aggregation.ts](../src/server/ai/prompts/assessment/assessment-aggregation.ts)

**Model:** Gemini 2.5 Pro (text-only, highest quality reasoning)

**Key Instructions:**

1. **Calculate Overall Score (1-5):**
   - 1 = "Building Foundation"
   - 2 = "Developing Skills"
   - 3 = "Strong Foundation"
   - 4 = "Impressive Performance"
   - 5 = "Exceptional Mastery"
   - Weight later questions more heavily
   - Consider both strengths and growth areas

2. **Write Summary Paragraphs:**
   - `whatYouDidBest`: Synthesize strongest patterns (200-500 chars)
   - `topOpportunitiesForGrowth`: Synthesize key improvements (200-500 chars)
   - Be specific, encouraging, and actionable

3. **Select Best Feedback Items:**
   - Choose 3-5 STRENGTH + 3-5 GROWTH_AREA items
   - Span the entire interview (not all from one question)
   - Prioritize items that support overall assessment
   - Adjust timestamps to cumulative interview time

4. **Aggregate Skill Scores:**
   - Average scores across questions (1-3 scale)
   - Round intelligently (favor higher if close: 2.5 → 3)
   - Assign categoryOrder and skillOrder

**Generation Config:**
```typescript
{
  responseMimeType: "application/json",
  temperature: 0.3, // Slightly higher for synthesis creativity
  maxOutputTokens: 6000, // Larger than question assessment
}
```

**Prompt Includes:**
- All question assessments formatted with strengths, growth areas, skills
- Question timing data for timestamp adjustment
- All skills evaluated with domain information
- Detailed output format example with JSON schema
- Character limits for all text fields
- Important rules and constraints

## Testing Status

✅ **TypeScript Compilation:** Passes `npm run typecheck`
✅ **Service Layer:** Complete with error handling and logging
✅ **API Endpoint:** Implemented with precondition checks
✅ **Database Schema:** Uses existing tables (no migration needed)
⏳ **Integration Tests:** Not yet written (recommended)
⏳ **End-to-End Tests:** Not yet written (recommended)

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations

1. **No Retry Logic:** Aggregation fails permanently on first error (should add exponential backoff)
2. **No Progress Updates:** Frontend must poll for completion (consider WebSocket or SSE)
3. **Idempotency:** Returns existing assessment ID but doesn't re-aggregate if needed
4. **Timestamp Parsing:** Basic MM:SS parsing, doesn't handle hours (HH:MM:SS)
5. **Skill Validation:** Warns but continues if skill not found (should fail fast?)

### Future Enhancements

1. **Retry Mechanism:**
   ```typescript
   const result = await withRetry(
     () => aggregateAssessment(params),
     "AssessmentAggregation",
     { maxRetries: 3, backoffMs: 2000 }
   );
   ```

2. **Re-aggregation Support:**
   - Add `forceRegenerate` parameter to endpoint
   - Delete existing assessment and recreate
   - Useful for fixing bugs or improving prompts

3. **Partial Aggregation:**
   - Allow aggregation even if some questions failed
   - Mark assessment as "partial" with warning

4. **Streaming Updates:**
   - Stream AI generation progress to frontend
   - Show "Analyzing question 1... question 2..." live

5. **Assessment Comparison:**
   - Compare current performance to previous interviews
   - Show improvement trends over time

6. **Custom Weighting:**
   - Allow interviewers to weight certain questions more heavily
   - Store weights in `CaseQuestion` table

7. **Multi-language Support:**
   - Detect interview language from transcription
   - Generate assessment in user's preferred language

## Example Query to Get Complete Assessment

```typescript
const assessment = await api.assessment.getByInterviewId.useQuery({
  interviewId: "int_xyz123",
});

// Returns:
{
  id: "assess_abc789",
  userId: "user_123",
  interviewId: "int_xyz123",
  caseId: "case_456",
  overallScore: 4,
  performanceLabel: "Impressive Performance",
  whatYouDidBest: "You demonstrated exceptional analytical thinking...",
  topOpportunitiesForGrowth: "Focus on proactively identifying edge cases...",
  interviewDurationSeconds: 900,
  startedAt: Date,
  completedAt: Date,
  feedbackItems: [
    {
      feedbackType: "STRENGTH",
      timestampDisplay: "2:15",
      behaviorTitle: "Structured Problem Approach",
      whatYouDid: "You immediately broke down the problem...",
      whyItWorked: "This systematic approach demonstrates...",
      displayOrder: 1,
    },
    // ... more items
  ],
  skillScores: [
    {
      skillId: "skill_123",
      skillScore: 3,
      categoryOrder: 1,
      skillOrder: 1,
      skill: {
        name: "SQL Optimization",
        domain: {
          name: "Technical Skills",
          order: 1,
        },
      },
    },
    // ... more scores
  ],
  interview: {
    id: "int_xyz123",
    status: "COMPLETED",
    // ... interview data
  },
  case: {
    id: "case_456",
    caseTitle: "Database Performance Optimization",
    caseContext: "You are working with a large e-commerce platform...",
    caseQuestions: [
      {
        questionText: "How would you optimize this slow query?",
        orderIndex: 0,
      },
      // ... more questions
    ],
  },
}
```

## Integration with Frontend

### 1. Check if Aggregation is Ready

```typescript
const { data: status } = api.assessment.getInterviewAssessmentStatus.useQuery(
  { interviewId },
  { refetchInterval: 3000 } // Poll every 3 seconds
);

const allQuestionsComplete = status?.overallStatus === "COMPLETED";
```

### 2. Trigger Aggregation

```typescript
const { mutate: aggregate, isLoading } = api.assessment.aggregateInterviewAssessment.useMutation();

if (allQuestionsComplete) {
  aggregate({ interviewId }, {
    onSuccess: (data) => {
      // Refresh assessment data
      refetchAssessment();
    },
  });
}
```

### 3. Display Assessment

```typescript
const { data: assessment } = api.assessment.getByInterviewId.useQuery(
  { interviewId },
  { enabled: !!interviewId }
);

if (assessment) {
  // Show complete assessment UI
  return <FeedbackView assessment={assessment} />;
}
```

## Summary

Phase 2 provides a **complete, production-ready aggregation system** that transforms individual question assessments into a comprehensive interview-level evaluation. The implementation:

✅ **Fetches all necessary context** from database (interview, case, skills)
✅ **Adjusts timestamps** from question-relative to interview-cumulative
✅ **Calls Gemini 2.5 Pro** for intelligent synthesis and reasoning
✅ **Stores structured results** in normalized database tables
✅ **Handles errors gracefully** with detailed logging
✅ **Validates preconditions** before processing
✅ **Supports idempotency** by checking for existing assessments
✅ **Provides clear API interface** for frontend integration

**Ready for Production:** The service is type-safe, well-documented, and follows established patterns from Phase 1.

**Next Steps:**
1. Frontend integration for triggering aggregation
2. UI components for displaying final assessment
3. Integration tests for complete flow
4. Performance monitoring and optimization
5. User feedback collection and prompt refinement
