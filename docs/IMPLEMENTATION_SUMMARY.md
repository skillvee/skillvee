## üé¨ User Flow

### 1. Interview Start
1. User clicks "Start Interview"
2. Browser prompts for **screen + audio** permissions
3. Video recorder initializes MediaRecorder
4. First question recording starts automatically

### 2. During Interview
1. User sees current question in card above notepad
2. User answers question while AI listens
3. User clicks "Next Question" when ready
4. Confirmation dialog appears
5. User clicks "Continue"

### 3. Question Transition (Seamless)
1. Current recording stops
2. Video blob created and uploaded in background
3. New question recording starts immediately
4. AI receives transition message with new question context
5. User continues interview without interruption

### 4. Interview End
1. User clicks "Next Question" on last question (shows "End Interview")
2. Confirmation dialog shows "End Interview?"
3. Final recording stops and uploads
4. User redirected to results page

### 5. Results Page
1. All question videos displayed in gallery
2. Videos show upload status (UPLOADING/COMPLETED/FAILED)
3. Page polls every 5s for upload progress
4. User can play each video individually
5. Duration and file size displayed

## üîÑ Upload Retry Logic

```typescript
MAX_RETRIES = 3
BASE_DELAY = 1000ms

Attempt 1: Immediate
Attempt 2: Wait 2s  (1000 * 2^1)
Attempt 3: Wait 4s  (1000 * 2^2)

If all fail: Mark as FAILED in database
```

## üé® UI Components

### CurrentQuestionDisplay
```tsx
<CurrentQuestionDisplay
  questionText="Explain your approach to..."
  currentIndex={1}
  totalQuestions={5}
/>
```
Shows: "Question 2 of 5" + question text

### NextQuestionDialog

- Continue/End Interview button (disabled during transition)
- Different messages for last question
- Loading state with spinner

### Results Page - Video Gallery
- One card per question
- Badge showing upload status

INTERVIEW STRUCTURE:
This interview has 5 questions...

QUESTIONS AND FOLLOW-UPS:
Question 1: {text}
Skills Evaluated: {skills}
Follow-up Questions:
  1. {followup1}
  2. {followup2}
...

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Start with Question 1
- Ask follow-ups only if answer lacks detail
- When you receive QUESTION_TRANSITION, acknowledge and move to new question
```

### Question Transition Message
```
QUESTION_TRANSITION: We are now moving to Question 2.

Question 2: {questionText}

Skills to Evaluate: {skills}

Available Follow-ups (use if needed):
1. {followup1}
2. {followup2}

Please acknowledge the transition and begin discussing this question.
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

### Recording Fails
- User sees error alert
- Must restart entire interview
- No partial recovery

### Upload Fails (After 3 Retries)
- Recording marked as FAILED
- Interview can continue
- User sees error in results page
- Admin can manually re-upload

### User Closes Browser
- No recovery mechanism
- Partial recordings remain in database
- User must restart interview

### Stream Ends (User Stops Sharing)
- Automatic cleanup triggered
- Error shown to user
- Interview ends gracefully

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Issue #1: AI Not Greeting User First (Fixed 2025-10-17)

**Problem:**
After implementing the single screen sharing prompt, the AI stopped greeting the user immediately after screen sharing was granted. Instead, users had to speak first before the AI would respond.

**Root Cause:**

The sequence of operations in `startSession()` was incorrect:

1. ‚úÖ Connect to Gemini Live
2. ‚ùå **Start listening for audio** (`startListening()`)
3. ‚úÖ Send initial greeting message (`sendText()`)

When `startListening()` was called BEFORE the greeting message was sent, the microphone started capturing audio immediately. The Gemini Live API then waited for USER audio input first, rather than responding to the initial text prompt.

**Solution:**

After extensive debugging with comprehensive logging, the root cause was discovered: the AI was responding to context messages with empty output because the messages were structured incorrectly. The solution was to use the existing `sendInitialGreeting()` method which sends a message **from the user's perspective**, naturally prompting the AI interviewer to respond.

```typescript
// FINAL FIX (working):
await geminiLive.connect(...)
// ... setup ...
geminiLive.sendInitialGreeting()    // ‚úÖ Sends: "Hello! I'm here for the interview..."
await geminiLive.startListening()   // ‚úÖ THEN start listening
```

The `sendInitialGreeting()` method sends: `"Hello! I'm here for the [job title] interview. Please introduce yourself and let's begin!"` which is from the candidate's perspective, naturally triggering the AI to introduce themselves as the interviewer.

**Changes Made:**

1. **Added `sendText` method to `GeminiLiveClient` class**
   - **File:** `src/lib/gemini-live.ts` (lines 1008-1014)
   - Made `sendText` a public method for flexibility

2. **Added `sendText` to TypeScript interface**
   - **File:** `src/hooks/useGeminiLive.ts` (line 39)
   - Added to `UseGeminiLiveActions` interface for proper type checking

3. **Fixed session initialization to use `sendInitialGreeting()`**
   - **File:** `src/components/interview/LiveInterviewSession.tsx` (lines 344-349)
   - Use `sendInitialGreeting()` instead of sending context as user message
   - Reordered: greeting BEFORE `startListening()`
   - Removed verbose logging

4. **Cleaned up excessive debugging logs**
   - **File:** `src/lib/gemini-live.ts` (WebSocket client methods)
   - Removed verbose console logs while keeping error logging

**Result:**

‚úÖ AI now greets the candidate immediately after screen sharing
‚úÖ Natural conversation flow restored
‚úÖ No need for user to speak first
‚úÖ `sendText` method properly exposed through hook

**Reference:**

- Gemini Live API requires `clientContent` to trigger a response
- Once `startListening()` is active, the API prioritizes audio input over text messages
- Proper sequence: Connect ‚Üí Send greeting ‚Üí Start listening
