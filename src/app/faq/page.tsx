        },
        {
          question: "What should I expect in my first interview session?",
          answer: "Your first session will be an assessment to understand your current level. The AI will ask a mix of basic questions across different areas (Python, SQL, statistics, behavioral) and provide gentle feedback to help you improve."

          question: "How realistic are the AI interviews?",
          answer: "Very realistic! Our AI is trained on thousands of actual interview questions from top tech companies. It conducts structured interviews with follow-up questions, technical challenges, and behavioral scenarios that mirror real interview experiences."
        },
        {
          question: "What types of questions can I practice?",
          answer: "We cover all major areas: Technical Skills (Python, SQL, R, machine learning algorithms, statistics), Case Studies (business problems, A/B testing, data analysis), Behavioral Questions (leadership, problem-solving, communication), and Company-Specific scenarios based on actual interview patterns."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I choose specific companies to practice for?",
          answer: "Yes! You can select from our database of 500+ companies including Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix, and many others. Each company has customized question sets based on their actual interview processes."
        },
        {
          question: "How does the AI provide feedback?",

          question: "Can I retake interviews or practice the same questions?",

        },
        {
          question: "How long does it take to get matched with opportunities?",

        },
        {
          question: "What happens when a company expresses interest?",
          answer: "You'll receive a notification and can review the opportunity. If interested, you can connect directly with the company. If not, simply decline and continue practicing - there's no pressure or obligation."

        },
        {
          question: "How do you make money if it's free for users?",

          question: "Are there any usage limits?",
          answer: "No daily or monthly limits on practice sessions. You can use SkillVee as much as you want. The only \"limit\" is that we focus on quality matches rather than quantity when connecting you with opportunities."
        },
        {
          question: "Will this always be free?",
          answer: "Yes, our core platform will remain free. We may introduce premium features in the future (like 1-on-1 coaching or advanced analytics), but the essential interview practice and job matching will always be available at no cost."
