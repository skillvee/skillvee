            SkillVee Company Terms of Service
          </h1>

          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
            This Agreement is made between the organization using our hiring platform ('Company') and SkillVee Corporation ('SkillVee'). 
            Companies may access and evaluate candidates ('Candidates') through our AI-powered interview platform.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">1. Platform Usage and Access</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            Companies agree to use the SkillVee platform solely for legitimate hiring and recruitment purposes. Company accounts must be created 
            by authorized personnel with proper hiring authority within the organization.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">2. Candidate Interactions and Hiring</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Companies agree to conduct all candidate communications, interview scheduling, and hiring discussions exclusively through the SkillVee 
            platform during the evaluation period.

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">If a Company wishes to hire a Candidate introduced through SkillVee, they must:</p>

            Companies acknowledge that SkillVee has invested significant resources in sourcing, screening, and presenting Candidates. Companies

            processes and fee arrangements.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            This restriction applies for <strong>24 months</strong> after the Company's last interaction with a Candidate through the platform, 
            unless alternative arrangements are made in writing with SkillVee.
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 ml-4">
            <li>Maintain confidentiality of all Candidate data</li>
            <li>Not share assessment materials outside their hiring team</li>
            <li>Delete Candidate data upon request or within 12 months of evaluation completion</li>
            <li>Use data only for the intended hiring decision</li>
